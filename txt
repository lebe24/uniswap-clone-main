========= Task
So, I challenge you to change your contract to only allow a set # of NFTs to be minted (for example, maybe you want only 50 NFTs to be minted max!!). It'd be even more epic if on your website it said something like 4/50 NFTs minted so far or something like that to make your user feel super special when they get an NFT!!!
Hint, you'll need something in solidity called require. And, you'll like also need to create a function like getTotalNFTsMintedSoFar for your web app to call.
